# Morra (dApp using Reach)
This sample game simulation was created by using the blockchain Reach development system. https://reach.sh/

The game of Morra is played between two or more players. The game consists of throwing a number of fingers (0-5) and guessing the total between you and your opponent. The winner is the one who guesses correctly. If both guess correctly, it is a draw. Play continues until a winner is declared.

This is a simulated game between two players, Bob and Alice. A random number of fingers is thrown for each player, and random guesses are based on the number of fingers thrown.
